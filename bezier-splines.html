        "Following the steps outlined on codeproject.com, we want the first and
        second derivatives to be continuous across the spline boundary. This will
        give us two equations (one for each derivative) at each spline interface
        which we use to find the control points."

        first bezier curve is implemented in the bezier function
        (bsplines-01-bezier.png)

        ---
    
        the article then states that "at the left boundary of an 'i-th'
        segment we can write: B′[i](0)=B′[i−1](1)".
        (`[i]` and `[i-1]` are subscripts)

        what this means is that the start of the next segment's derivative
        B′[i](0), that is where the `t` input is 0, is equal to the end of
        the previous segments derivative B′[i−1], that is where the `t` input
        is 1.

        in other words, if i is the index of the current segment we're
        operating on, then the first point on the derivative is the
        same as the last point on the derivative of the previous segment.
        (bsplines-03-derivative-overlap.png)
        in fact, if we look at that image, we can see that the plotted
        derivative of each segment (green and blue) overlaps (since the
        derivative is at 50% opacity of the bezier curve, and the combining
        transparent graphs of the derivative overlap to make a new colour.
        by default, a large portion of the derivative graph wouldn't
        be visible on the canvas, so it has to be scaled back into the
        canvas' coordinate system).

        this is important because it will let us connect the end point of
        the previous segment with the start point of the next segment
        seamlessly and smoothly (both coloured in white and overlapping).

        TODO: REVISIT (not sure if it's aobut the second halves or just
        the end points)
        the article then rewrites the above equality of start and end
        segment points by breaking it down into comparing component
        points of each segment. in this case, the sum of points 0 and 1 of
        the current segment i, is said to be equal to the sum of points 2
        and 3 of the previous segment, i - 1:
        -3P[0, i] + 3P[1, i] = −3P[2, i − 1] + 3P[3, i − 1]

        instead of graphing it, i think it's simpler to compare the points
        that are generated. otherwise, i think to make these overlap, we'd
        need to graph the second segment's derivative in reverse. what
        we should see is equality between the sum of p2, p3 where t = [0.5, 1]
        for B[i - 1] (i.e. when we compute points the second half of the first segment)
        and points p0, p1 where t = [0, 0.5] for B[i] (i.e. when we compute points
        for the first half of the second segment). using very few subdivisions,
        6 in this case:

        b(i - 1)'s points p2 and p3:
        // subdiv 4/6:
        //     p2p3x 0
        //     p2p3y -1536
        // subdiv 5/6:
        //     p2p3x 0
        //     p2p3y -1536
        subdiv 6/6:
            p2p3x 0
            p2p3y -1536

        compare to b(i)'s points p0 and p1:
        // subdiv 4/6:
        //     p0p1x 0
        //     p0p1y -1536
        // subdiv 5/6:
        //     p0p1x 0
        //     p0p1y -1536
        subdiv 6/6:
            p0p1x 0
            p0p1y -1536

        this totally checks out.

        ---

        equation (1):

        building off of 
        -3P[0, i] + 3P[1, i] = −3P[2, i − 1] + 3P[3, i − 1],
        
        the next step is to define K by recognizing that
        each piece of the left hand side is can equal another piece on the
        right hand side:

        P[0, i] = P[3, i − 1] = Ki,
        that means that these variables are always equivalent and we
        can say they're Ki, where Ki is the 'i-th' knot point, and a knot
        is an endpoint.

        we can then simplify the initial expression by using Ki:
        -3Ki + 3P[1, i] = -3P[2, i - 1] + 3Ki
        3P[1, i] = -3P[2, i - 1] + 6Ki
        3P[1, i] + 3P[2, i - 1] = 6Ki
        P[1, i] + P[2, i - 1] = 2Ki

        so now we have part of an equation to determine the control points
        for a start and end point
        P[1, i] + P[2, i - 1] = 2Ki

        TODO: REVISIT

        calculate the second derivative
        (no screenshot because it looks jacked?!)

        ---

        TODO: REVISIT

        we do the same exercise on the second derivative as we did
        on the first except with some additional data?

        6P[0, i] - 12P[1, i] + 6P[2, i] = 
            6P[1, i - 1] - 12P[2, i - 1] + 6P[3, i - 1]
            
        This too is simplified, acknowledging the shared knot
        point, we get equation (2):
        -2P[1, i] + P[2, i] = P[1, i - 1] - 2P[2, i - 1]

        ---

        equations (1) and (2) only work for internal knots which
        are the places spline segments come together. that means
        we can't use it for the first or very last knot because
        no spline segments come together at those points.

        that means to get all the internal knots, there are (2n - 1)
        of them to compute, for 2n unknowns. for example, if
        n is 4 then ther are 8 unknowns in total, but only 6 (2 * [4 - 1])
        need to be computed because 2 out of those 8 are for the beginning
        and end.

        ---

        TODO: REVISIT

        we now need to deal with the end points of the b spline,
        so for those we just make their second derivative linear
        (since a second derivative == 0 means ... ?)
